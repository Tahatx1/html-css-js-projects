# 👋 Hey, I'm Taha!

This repo is where I drop my Javascript web projects.

Right now, there’s **one project live**, but trust me—**a whole lot more is on the way**. I've been cooking up a bunch of ideas and it's all gonna land here soon, so hit that ⭐️ if you wanna stay in the loop.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Dark Mode toggle** – This JavaScript file is responsible for handling the dark-light mode toggle functionality on the web page. It interacts with HTML elements, such as the toggle switch, navigation bar, images, and text box, to dynamically update styles based on the selected theme.
- **Note Taking App** – This JavaScript file is responsible for handling a simple JavaScript note-taking app with a clean, minimalist interface. Users can add new notes by clicking the plus icon and remove any note by double-clicking on it. Each note appears as a card, making it easy to organize and quickly access your thoughts or to-dos.



*(More dropping soon. Stay tuned.)*
