# 👋 Hey, I'm Taha!

This repo is where I drop my Javascript web projects.

Right now, there’s **one project live**, but trust me—**a whole lot more is on the way**. I've been cooking up a bunch of ideas and it's all gonna land here soon, so hit that ⭐️ if you wanna stay in the loop.

## 🚀 Projects

- **Dark Mode toggle** – This JavaScript file is responsible for handling the dark-light mode toggle functionality on the web page. It interacts with HTML elements, such as the toggle switch, navigation bar, images, and text box, to dynamically update styles based on the selected theme.



*(More dropping soon. Stay tuned.)*
